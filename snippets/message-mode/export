The Boost Libraries do not have an ECCN because they are not covered
by the EAR (Export Administration Regulations).  The reason they are
not covered by the EAR is that they are legally considered “published”
software.  Software is “published” when it becomes generally
accessible to the interested public for free or at a price that does
not exceed the cost of reproduction and distribution.
